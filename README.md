🚀 Projectile Motion: Master Class & Orbital Arc SimulatorA dual-purpose web application that combines a physics educational module with a high-fidelity, gamified projectile motion simulator. Built entirely in a single HTML file using HTML5 Canvas, CSS3, and Vanilla JavaScript.📖 OverviewThis project is designed to teach and test the concepts of Kinematics and 2D Vector Motion.The Master Class: A scrollable educational section explaining definitions, vectors, and the 7 key kinematic equations.Orbital Arc (The Game): An interactive lab where users launch projectiles on different planets, dealing with variable gravity, wind resistance, and atmospheric drag.✨ Features🎓 Educational ModuleVisual Vector Breakdown: Explains how velocity splits into $V_x$ and $V_y$ components.Formula Grid: Quick reference cards for calculating Range, Max Height, Time of Flight, etc.Video Library: Placeholders for educational embeds (CrashCourse, Professor Dave).🎮 Orbital Arc Simulator4 Unique Environments:🌍 Earth: Standard gravity ($9.8 m/s^2$), mild wind.🌑 Luna (Moon): Low gravity ($1.6 m/s^2$), no air resistance (vacuum).🔴 Mars: Medium gravity ($3.7 m/s^2$), heavy variable winds.🪐 Titan: Low gravity ($1.35 m/s^2$) but very dense atmosphere (high drag).Real-Time Telemetry: Live readout of Altitude, Distance to Target, and Velocity.Vector Visualization: Toggle real-time velocity vector arrows (Green for X, Red for Y) during flight.Time Dilation: Control simulation speed (1.0x Real, 0.5x Slow, 0.2x Matrix Mode).Progression System: Earn ranks (Cadet to Legend) and unlock visual skins for the projectile based on win streaks."Earn Your Hint" System: Unlock a trajectory prediction line by solving a physics math problem based on current environmental variables.🛠️ How to RunSince the project is contained within a single file, no build process or server installation is required.Download the code.Save the file as index.html.Open the file in any modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari).🕹️ How to PlaySelect Environment: Click a planet card on the title screen to initialize the physics engine with that planet's gravity and atmosphere.Aim & Fire:Adjust Angle slider ($0^\circ - 90^\circ$).Adjust Force slider (Initial Velocity).Click LAUNCH.The Objective: Land the projectile within the red target zone.Hit: You gain a streak point and rank progress.Miss: Streak resets. Analyze the "Status Report" to adjust your next shot.Using Hints:If you have battery charge (you start with 3), click HINT.Solve the physics question presented (e.g., Calculate Vertical Velocity).If correct, a trajectory line will appear to guide your aim.🧮 The Physics EngineThe simulation uses a custom JavaScript physics loop running at 60 FPS (modified by the time scale).Key Calculations Used in Code:Drag: Calculated as a simplified coefficient based on velocity: drag = air_density * velocityAcceleration X: ax = -(drag * vx) + wind_forceAcceleration Y: ay = -(drag * vy) + gravityEuler Integration: Used to update position and velocity every frame.🎨 CustomizationYou can easily modify the game by editing the script section:Change Planets: Edit the PLANETS constant array to add new worlds (e.g., Jupiter with high gravity).Adjust Difficulty: Change the target radius in gameState.target.r.Modify Questions: Add new math problems to the QUESTION_TYPES array.📂 File StructureThe code is a "Monolith" (Single File Component):CSS: Located in <style>, handles the dark "Tech/Space" UI theme, animations, and modal layouts.HTML: Structure for the educational content and the game UI wrapper.JS: Located in <script>, handles the Canvas drawing, physics loop, game logic, and DOM manipulation.📄 LicenseThis project is open-source. Feel free to use it for educational purposes, physics labs, or as a base for your own game.
